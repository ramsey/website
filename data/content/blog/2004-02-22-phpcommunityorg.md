Back in December 2003, [Chris Shiflett announced on his Web site](http://shiflett.org/blog/2003/dec/php-community-site) (an announcement that was [carried over to PHP.net](http://php.net/archive/2003.php)) his intention to launch a site for the <abbr title="recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> community by the PHP community.  He filtered through mass amounts of e-mail in response to the announcement and set up a wiki at [PHPCommunity.org](http://www.phpcommunity.org).  Since then, the site following has grown by leaps and bounds, though the site launch may not be for quite some time.  This is an exciting opportunity for the PHP community, and I'm excited to be involved.  The advent of this community site has inspired me to finally put this Web site together and start doing what I enjoy most: writing.
