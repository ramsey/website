Back in December 2003, [Chris Shiflett announced on his Web site][1] (an
announcement that was [carried over to PHP.net][2]) his intention to launch a
site for the PHP community by the PHP community. He filtered through massive
amounts of e-mail in response to the announcement and set up a wiki at
[PHPCommunity.org][3]. Since then, the site following has grown by leaps and
bounds, though the site launch may not be for quite some time. This is an
exciting opportunity for the PHP community, and I'm excited to be involved.
The advent of this community site has inspired me to finally put this website
together and start doing what I enjoy most: writing.
